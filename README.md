# Hi! I'm José 👋 😃

I'm a petroleum engineer who has teaching experience 🧑🏻‍🏫 . Last year, I decided to switch careers and become a Frontend developer in the mid-term and a full stack developer in the long-term 🧑🏻‍💻 . That's why I'm currently working on personal projects that help me practice and improve what I've learned so far.

## My skills:
- Git
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap / Tailwind
- React
- Vue
- PHP
- MySQL
