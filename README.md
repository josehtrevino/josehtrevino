# Hi! This is Jose ðŸ‘‹

I'm a petroleum engineer who has experience in teaching. Last year, I decided to switch careers and become a Frontend developer in the mid-term and a full stack developer in the long-term. That's why I'm currently working on personal projects that help me practice and improve what I've learned so far.

## My skills:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap / Tailwind
- React
- Vue
- PHP
- MySQL
